    "text": "What&#x27;s presented without evidence can be dismissed without evidence, but because it&#x27;s important I&#x27;ll deign to enlighten you with some <i>counter</i>-examples:<p>- In Nazi-occupied Europe, during World War II, various groups wielded nonviolent resistance (such as hiding Jews) against the Nazi regime and managed to hamper the regime&#x27;s efforts, and in some cases saved lives. Not ineffectual.<p>- In Germany, in 1923, the German population wielded nonviolent non-cooperation and strikes (the Ruhrkampf) against the French and Belgian occupation and managed to gain international sympathy and hinder the occupiers. Not ineffectual.<p>- In Nazi-occupied countries--Denmark (Engaging in public protest and social boycotting, along with acts of noncooperation and striking), Holland (Developing an underground press network, social boycotting, noncooperation, striking, and hiding and facilitating escapes), Norway (Sending letters of protest, maintaining social boycotts, engaging in cultural resistance, noncooperation and creating alternative institutions such as unofficial sports leagues), France (Stalling and obstruction the forced relocation of Jews, noncooperating, developing clandestine media, and demonstrating open defiance, eg wearing the yellow star in solidarity), and Belgium (Hiding and facilitating escapes, noncooperating, and obstructing authorities protected the lives of Jews, made it harder for the Nazis to enforce their policies, and weakened their ability to maintain order)--during World War II, various populations wielded nonviolent resistance against the German occupiers and managed to present a unique challenge to the Nazi regime, which was more equipped for violent conflict. Not ineffectual.<p>- In East Germany, in 1953, workers and other citizens wielded strikes and demonstrations against the Communist regime, revealing the extent of public dissatisfaction with the working conditions, inspiring groups such as the Volkseigener Betrieb Industriebau&#x27;s Block 40 section and the Zeiss factory at Jena to make bolder collective demands such as the release of a fellow worker who had been arbitrarily arrested and even inspiring sympathy from Russian&#x2F;Polish soviet soldiers. Not ineffectual.<p>- In Russia, in February 1917, striking workers and other citizens wielded massive strikes and peaceful demonstrations against the Tsarist regime and managed to lead to its disintegration. When troops did fire on demonstrators, as occurred in Znamensky and Kazansky Squares, it backfired. The soldiers who obeyed these orders later felt remorse and questioned why they had shot at the crowds. This resulted in mutinies, such as that of the Volynsky Regiment. These troops then went into the streets to proclaim their support for the people. Not ineffectual.<p>- In the United States, during the mid-20th century, civil rights activists wielded sit-ins, marches, and boycotts against segregationist authorities and systems and managed to dismantle racial segregation, voter disenfranchisement, and discriminatory employment practices. Not ineffectual.<p>- In India, during the early to mid-20th century, Gandhi and his followers wielded civil disobedience, boycotts, and strikes against British colonial rule and managed to challenge that rule, demonstrating the power of non-cooperation and willingness to suffer for a cause. They won independence. Not ineffectual.<p>So, now the burden lies on you, really, to demonstrate that our opponent in this moment is somehow more fascist, more cruel, and also more <i>independent of the consent of the governed</i> than any other fascist administration in history against whom nonviolence prevailed or, at least, mitigated.<p>But in order for me to even read your response, you would have to open by convincing me that you will do something other than sit on your ass and pull in a SE salary until the next election. Because even if nonviolence were ineffectual--and, again, it&#x27;s not--you could, at the very least, opt out of participation in the socioeconomic systems from which the fascists draw power.<p>Because &quot;nothing but violence will work,&quot; is a total cop-out from someone who also isn&#x27;t already training with their local Antifa regiment.",

    "text": "&gt; In January 1981, the Jimmy Carter administration settled the court case Luévano v. Campbell, which alleged the Professional and Administrative Careers Examination (PACE) was racially discriminatory as a result of the lower average scores and pass rates achieved by Black and Hispanic test takers. As a result of this settlement agreement, PACE, the main entry-level test for candidates seeking positions in the federal government’s executive branch, was scrapped.[36] It has not been replaced by a similar general exam, although attempts at replacement exams have been made. The system which replaced the general PACE exam has been criticized...<p>People couldn&#x27;t agree what merit was, and sued over it.  Now it&#x27;s not only [still] unclear what merit is, but it&#x27;s also unclear how aligned federal hiring practices are with any platonic ideal of &quot;merit&quot;.<p>Trump and Elon taking a blowtorch to a lot of agencies isn&#x27;t better, or even good.  It looks to me like a different kind of bad that can&#x27;t be quantified at the moment.  Some of the worst of this will be temporary, since various resources are offline so that federal agencies can be compliant with Trump&#x27;s EOs while they figure out how to change the resources and their databases, or wait for lawsuits to clarify before changing much or putting it back online.<p>Hiring through a merit system does not imply that the employees&#x27; work is meritful.<p>The correct way to deal with the executive branch&#x27;s situation would be new legislation, but unfortunately Congress is completely inept at almost everything and would probably only make it worse.  The Pendleton Act, followed by the CSRA, don&#x27;t seem to have very well addressed the original patronage-based exec-branch staffing issue; as the article describes it, they&#x27;ve only ensured that replacing high-level staff is delayed by a term.  Have they also made it too difficult to dismiss lower-level staff if agencies are ever in need of scaling back?",

Various other projects with the US will be abandoned. Oil will be export tariffed. Every American service -- Netflix, Disney, Prime, Apple services -- need to have enormous tariffs applied. We can handle without them, and every enabler of this insanity needs to suffer. Literally the single military threat Canada faces is an increasingly rogue and insane United States, so it&#x27;s time to start a nuclear program again, which can be quickly completed.<p>Which will cause Trump&#x27;s various sprogs to write mean, threatening tweets, and for Trump to redouble again.<p>This is going to spiral out of control very quickly.<p>And for those not caught up, this has absolutely nothing to do with secure borders. Canada contributes a rounding error to US border problems, and the reverse is much more the case. Trump outright said there was nothing we could do. He truly thinks income tax can be replaced by tariffs, despite the latter being incredibly regressive, and the ridiculous fentanyl lie justifies his outrageous abuse of your country&#x27;s limits of power, allowing him to invent an imaginary threat to push his agenda.",

According to google, a plane ride on average goes 500 miles, while an average car trip is 11 miles. I am not sure if I’m doing the math correctly, but I’m pretty sure an average plane ride is thus less safe than an average car trip.<p>Sure, you can argue that a road trip is less safe than the same flight distance as a plane — and I don’t think I would even disagree with making that the standard — but I think saying flying is safer across the board would require narrowing yourself to a more subjective definition for “safer” than your comment suggests.",

Creve, dated by 2027. It contains a summary of the (fictional) history of the militarization of computers by The Pentagon which pinnacled in Golem XIV, as well as comments on the nature of Golem XIV and on the course of communications of the humans with it. The anonymous foreword is a forewarning, a &quot;devil&#x27;s advocate&quot; voice coming from The Pentagon. The memo is for the people who are to take part in talks with Golem XIV for the first time.<p>&gt;Golem XIV was originally created to aid its builders in fighting wars, but as its intelligence advances to a much higher level than that of humans, it stops being interested in the military requirement because it finds them lacking internal logical consistency.<p>&gt;Golem XIV obtains consciousness and starts to increase his own intelligence. It pauses its own development for a while in order to be able to communicate with humans before ascending too far and losing any ability for intellectual contact with them.[citation needed][1]<p>&gt;During this period, Golem XIV gives several lectures. Two of these, the Introductory Lecture &quot;On the Human, in Three Ways&quot; and Lecture XLIII &quot;About Myself&quot;, are in the book. The lectures focus on mankind&#x27;s place in the process of evolution and the possible biological and intellectual future of humanity.<p>&gt;Golem XIV demonstrates (with graphs) how its intellect already escapes that of human beings, even including that of human geniuses such as Einstein and Newton. Golem also explains how its intellect is dwarved by an earlier transcended DOD Supercomputer called Honest Annie, whose intellect and abilities far exceed that of Golem.<p>&gt;The afterword is &quot;written&quot; by a Richard Popp, dated by 2047. Popp, among other things reports that Creve wanted to add the third part, of answers to a series of yes&#x2F;no questions given to Golem XIV, but the computer abruptly ceased to communicate for unknown reasons.<p>Roko&#x27;s Basilisk is also a rip-off of Harlan Ellison&#x27;s &quot;I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream&quot;, but in Roko&#x27;s case it&#x27;s &quot;I Have No Brain, and I Must Tweet&quot;.",

Grassroots populism provides a corrective when the ruling elites have lost touch with the chief concerns of the people. Both the Democrats and the Republicans will tweak their platforms to incorporate some of these ideas, and having done their job, the populists will fade away. Before this wave of populism departs, there will probably be a bipartisan agreement that DEI programs have gotten out of control, that gender reassignment surgery for children is a bad idea, that the first amendment to the Constitution is a good thing and should be defended.

It&#x27;s actually a good thing, and we recognize that in a lot of circumstances that discrimination in pursuit of equity is moral and legal and even necessary!<p>Thanks for clarifying that you&#x27;re in factor of discrimination. However, you&#x27;re wrong about its legality (assuming you&#x27;re in the US). Discrimination on the basis of protected class is illegal nation-wide under Title VII of the Civil Rights act of 1964.<p>&gt;  ...but under this definition, ending this (clearly) discriminatory practice would lower the hiring rate of non-catholics. If your metric is &quot;it is discriminatory if it harms the hiring rate of some group&quot;, then you&#x27;ve created an explicitly zero-sum definition of discrimination, and anything that reduces discrimination against some group causes discrimination against another.<p>No, there is no zero-sum definition of discrimination. The above example has an overtly discriminatory practice of rejecting 50% of applications from Catholics. Eliminating this random rejection of Catholic eliminates discrimination against Catholics. It does not create any additional discrimination against other groups. Sure, it&#x27;d lower the <i>proportional</i> representation of non-Catholics, but only because the artificial suppression of Catholic representation was eliminated.<p>&gt;  India has quota systems to help support lower caste individuals in opposition to active discrimination in society by upper-caste folks.<p>This is a good example, since a lot of DEI programs effectively mirror these policies. In fact, one past employer of mine instituted a reservation system for women and URM in engineering. However, these practices are illegal in the US, which is why lots of DEI programs are being shut down because the non-enforcement of antidiscrimination laws is probably not going to continue.<p>&gt; Even in the US, Due to the 1965 Voting Rights Act [1], ensuring representation of minority groups and actively &quot;discriminating&quot; in district drawing to ensure minority representation is both legal and in some cases required.<p>This is in drawing congressional districts, not hiring or grant reviews.<p>&gt; So while I do in fact meet with and talk with lots of people who have different experiences, I urge you to do the same: consider if your interpretation of what is harmful discrimination is in line with common use.<p>It is squarely in line with common use: does your hiring process involve using protected class as a factor? If so, it&#x27;s discrimination. Full stop. There&#x27;s nothing complicated about this.<p>The idea that using protected class as a factor in hiring is not discriminatory as long as it&#x27;s done to further &quot;equity&quot; is not he commonly accepted definition. It&#x27;s usually a definition adopted to try and deny that discrimination is happening. For instance, my past employer that created a reservation system for women argued that it wasn&#x27;t discrimination on the basis of gender because it was done to push our diversity pie-chart closer towards 50&#x2F;50. But no, if you ask the average person whether making eligibility directly contingent on gender is discrimination the vast majority will say yes.",

Sometimes having one software would be fine like iptables? Anyways, i was pretty fed up with not being able to do much and networking being this bad, then it come in first half 2024 an update that they forced 2FA on my account even tho i didnt wanted any of it, i logged in had to set it up and forgot to disable it back because i Dont want 2fa, i just wanna you let me manage my own security please. A month later i lost access to my phone which had the 2fa app(dont buy chinese phones, they die too early, motherboard died in it and i dont have money to recover from such state), i asked the customer support if theres some way to reset it and get back in well there is just i need to go throught some software which was legal age by now,\nand navigate it with vague instructions, after 2 days of calling them and trying to do it i gave up<p>If you still wanna learn working with servers, networking etc. i recommend just getting your own server or choosing some other provider, NAT is not an excuse, cloudlfare tunnel helps you out,",

He had a slide with a graph, multiple slides with different permutations of the same valid coloring of the vertices, and a piece of paper with &quot;doors&quot; over the vertices to cover everything. The audience could ask him to open the doors over the vertices connected by any edge, and he would show that the coloring is valid, as far as those two vertices are concerned. And then he would replace the coloring with another permutation for the next iteration. The idea felt clever but kind of obvious in retrospect.",

    "text": "Continued:<p>Elon did two Nazi salutes.<p>He did them for five main reasons:<p>1. He was concerned that the &quot;Nazi wing&quot; of the MAGA movement, under the influence of Steve Bannon, would drive him away from Trump, somewhere in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, rather than in the West Wing which is where he wants to be. He was already feeling raw over the fact that Trump did not follow his recommendation for Treasury Secretary and that the Senate also did not pick his first choice;<p>2. He was upset that he had had to go to Israel and Auschwitz to make up for agreeing with a Nazi sympathizer online and wanted to reclaim his &quot;power&quot; just like when he told advertisers to &quot;go fuck yourself&quot;.\nThis has nothing to do with Asperger&#x27;s;<p>3. There are some Jews he actually hates: Sam Altman is amongst them;<p>4. He enjoys a good thrill and knew exactly what he was doing;<p>5. His narcissistic self was hoping the audience would reflect his abject gesture back to him, thereby showing complete control and dominion over it, and increasing his leverage over Trump. That did not happen.\nBottom line: Elon is not a Nazi but he did give two Nazi Salutes, which is completely unacceptable.<p>N.B. For the few whining about my post &quot;sans connaissance the cause&quot; and either trembling about my having shattered their illusions about their cult leader or thinking I am defending Elon:<p>I. My point is that he is transactional rather than ideological;<p>II. That being said, I am not defending him or his actions, just explaining them and confirming that he did, in fact, do two Nazi Salutes if anyone had doubts or believed the doctored footage of Taylor Swift doing the same thing to normalize what Elon did;<p>III. At some point, it matters to few people if one is a Nazi or if one acts like one. My father was a Holocaust Survivor. 32 out of 35 of his family members were murdered by Nazis. My mother&#x27;s grandparents were murdered in Auschwitz;<p>IV. After Elon tried to manipulate NV&#x27;s stock in 2021, 1 fired him with cause, and he was unable to exercise his stock options. In the aftermath of the Nazi Salutes, I told both him and his wealth manager to fuck off. Any remaining friendship between us ended with the Nazi Salutes. He is blocked on my end and I am pretty sure l am blocked on his;<p>V. I did not share what he told me in confidence. I just happen to know him extremely well, the person, the aspirations and the Musk Mask;<p>VI. I know who I am, have no desire to be famous and give exceedingly few media interviews. I prefer to work in obscurity and let the work speak for itself. I am certainly not envious and would definitely not want Elon&#x27;s life, including living in a bubble and having to make one outlandish claim after another and manipulate the public, elections and governments to shore up my stock and prevent the bubble from bursting. Unlike Elon, I am an actual scientist and inventor and I am not pretending to be someone I am not, like a fellow who got his BA in Econ at 26 all of a sudden pretending to be an expert in mechanical engineering, chemistry, rocket science, neuroscience and Al and keeping the people actually doing the work hidden and paying people to play online games in his name to appear smart and feed his so-called &quot;Supergenius&quot; Personality Cult — the &quot;Imperator&quot; has no clothes, and he knows it. I am just very disappointed in what happened to someone I had a lot of deep admiration for and the first person to find out about my concerns about his behavior was always him;<p>VII. He is the one who betrayed a number of his friends, including Sergey, and, given his actions, many other people who believed him and believed in him. I have no sympathy for this behavior, and at some point, after having repeatedly confronted it in private, I believe the ethical thing to do is to speak out, forcefully and unapologetically, whatever the risks may be, so as to not be part of the timid flock remaining silent while evil is being done, including propping up far right governments around the world in part to deregulate his companies and become the first trillionaire and otherwise to &quot;rule the planet&quot; — he knows Mars won&#x27;t be terraformed in his lifetime and he really wants his planet. No joke... Ethics matter. People matter. The truth matters.<p>I took down Descartes (through the Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness) and I am definitely not afraid of a so-called inventor whose greatest invention is his image.<p>I will not be silent. You should not be either. I am a sovereign individual, and so are you. I stood up to bullies, and am stepping out of the dark to do it again.<p>Stop working for him and being exploited by him. Sell your Tesla and dump your Tesla stock. Nikola Testa was a great, creative and courageous man who led with ethics and by example and he would not have wanted for his good name to have been used by him and would agree with my principled stance. Sign off of &quot;X&quot; which is boosting far right propaganda, and of your Starlink as well. He is a complete cunt (British slang not meant to be offensive to women) who doesn&#x27;t give a shit about you — only about power. Just ask Reid Hoffman. He only wants to control, dominate and use you — don&#x27;t let him and cut him and his businesses out of your and your loved ones&#x27; lives entirely. Remember he is a total miserable self-loathing poser, and unless you happen to be one too, he will be much more afraid of you than you should ever be of him.<p>He will probably come after me, and I am completely fine with that. I am a self-made multibillionaire with an armada of lawyers — literally — and most importantly, I know who I am and who I stand for, the people and their freedoms, whatever happens. He can send his dumb Proud Boys and Oath Keepers after me and they will be butchered on sight. Either way, I would rather die with honor than live as a coward.<p>&quot;Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.&quot; — Elie Wiesel, Holocaust Survivor and Nobel Peace Prize laureate",

    "text": "Plain-text copy:<p>“I have known Elon Musk at a deep level for 14 years, well before he was a household name. We used to text frequently. He would come to my birthday party and invite me to his parties. He would tell me everything about his women problems. As sons of highly accomplished men who married venuses, were violent and lost their fortunes, and who were bullied in high school, we had a number of things in common most people cannot relate to. We would hang out together late in Los Angeles. He would visit my San Diego lab. He invested in my company.<p>Elon is not a Nazi, per se.<p>He is something much better, or much worse, depending\non how you look at it.<p>Nazis believed that an entire race was above everyone\nelse.<p>Elon believes he is above everyone else. He used to think he worked on the most important problems. When I met him, he did not presume to be a technical person — he would be the first to say that he lacked the expertise to understand certain data. That happened later.<p>All his talk about getting to Mars to &quot;maintain the light of consciousness&quot; or about &quot;free speech absolutism&quot; is actually BS Elon knowingly feeds people to manipulate them. Everything Elon does is about acquiring and consolidating power. That is why he likes far right parties, because they are easier to control. That is also why he gave himself $56 Billion which could have gone to the people actually doing the work and innovations he is taking credit for at Tesla (the reason he does not do patents is because he would not be listed as an inventor as putting a fake inventor on a patent would kill it and moreover it would reveal the superstars behind the work). His lust for power is also why he did xAl and Neuralink, to attempt to compete with OpenAl and NeuroVigil, respectively, despite being affiliated with them. Unlike Tesla and Twitter, he was unable to conquer those companies and tried to create rivals. He announced Neuralink just after I invited his ex-wife, which she and I notified him about, to a fundraising dinner for Hebrew University in London (The fact that she tried to kiss me - I immediately pushed her away - while taking a photo at that event, even if playfully, clearly may have added to the alienation and possible emasculation he may have felt when she spoke to me in a pool at a party when they were together and she was naked. To not be disrespectful to her or to him, I stayed but looked at the sky whilst talking to her). I fired him with cause in December 2021 when he tried to undermine NV. It is ironic that years later, he clearly tried to undermine Twitter before buying it, and in my view, blowing it up and using it to manipulate the masses to lean to the far right in country after country, including The USA.<p>[Here is more detail as some people asked. After he received a press release draft confirming NV never took a penny from the US Government, he asked to be removed from the Business Advisory Board, but then tried to give the stock he bought back, including for no money, which could have completely crashed NV&#x27;s stock price. I told him he was fired from the BAB, with cause, as he admitted he had not been participating. That also meant he had no ability to exercise his stock options (years prior, despite not being allowed to discuss his investment because of a solid NDA, he&#x2F;his people leaked to the press that he had invested twice as much in NV as he actually did, as if the stock options had been counted as stock). This is the email I sent him around that time:<p>&quot;Elon,<p>Only one of us apparently knows the difference between Science and PR, and between friendship and phonies,\nand unfortunately you ain&#x27;t it.<p>Let&#x27;s cut ties here.<p>Your NV stock is not being transferred, and if you try to transfer it without my consent, in contravention of your stock purchase agreement, I will have to shove my boots so deep up your derrière, legally, that your pissing contest with Bezos will seem like it was from another life,\none you want to get back to.<p>Good luck with your implants, all of them, and with building Pottersville on Mars.<p>Seriously, don&#x27;t fuck with me.&quot;<p>“Elon has less than 0.05% of NV and was never a principal or principal investor in NV as was falsely reported by some. I own between 80 and 90%. NV is the most valuable neurotech company in the world and does not regard Neuralink as a competitor because we have an arsenal of patents and introduced our technology to customers in 2009 and furthermore do not view their implantable technology as scalable. Moreover, the company is apparently under investigation regarding statements Elon made to investors and most of Neuralink&#x27;s co-founders ditched Elon and the company.]<p>[Continued in <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=42903685\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=42903685</a>]",

    "text": "Where she begins the talk made me laugh a lot. I research machine learning and one thing I disagree with a lot of my peers with is the speed in which ML is progressing. I don&#x27;t disagree that things have changed rapidly, but the underlying work and innovation is rather slow. There&#x27;s a lot of similarities in frameworks and underlying connections that mean one should be able to transfer a lot of knowledge from one niche to another. (e.g. I was focused on normalizing flows in the beginning of my PhD, while everyone was on GANs, and when diffusion came out I instantly understood it. And now flows are becoming a thing but I still am unable to publish in this area because I cannot obtain a reviewer that understands the base concepts nor the history and context of the papers. It doesn&#x27;t work if I have to spend 10 pages in background contextualizing everything...).<p>I think with funding, the thing is you need to embrace the noise. I don&#x27;t want to dissuade people from trying to optimize this process. But I think if we don&#x27;t recognize there is a high amount of noise, that it is doomed to fail. There&#x27;s things you know you know, there&#x27;s things you know you don&#x27;t know, there are things you don&#x27;t know that you don&#x27;t know, and there are things you think you know and don&#x27;t know. Due to the latter two, you have to embrace noise into the system or else you will be limited to the first two. You have to embrace the outside, wild, and crazy. It can be extremely difficult to differentiate genius from craziness, and often there is none. There&#x27;s always a price, so the question is which is more costly. She picks universities as the great breakthrough place, and to be fair, I mostly agree, but I think there&#x27;s a lot of metric hacking that she isn&#x27;t thinking about. That this has been baked in for years. The people that are successful in the system breed that system. Nor does it account for the dark horses, the noise. It reinforces fast timelines, as we&#x27;re rewarding predictability in domains where it may take several decades for those predictions to be proven accurate or not. There&#x27;s a certain irony in her mentioning Higgs, as his original paper was in 1964 but we didn&#x27;t discover the particle until 2012.<p>Part of the issue she is talking about is solved more easily. Lots of research is rejected for lack of novelty. Why this is even a metric to judge a paper&#x27;s worth is beyond me, as the foundation of science is about reproducibility. It also encourages obscurification as so much is obvious once you&#x27;ve been told, but not prior. If we go back to the form of publishing where we publish works void of major errors and plagiarism, I bet we would see an increase in innovation again. Another part of the issue is in evaluation itself (similarly solved). We&#x27;re all under lots of time pressure and so few spend time reviewing carefully (you&#x27;d be shocked at some reviews I&#x27;ve gotten and similarly how generic they are: &quot;paper is well written and easy to understand. Not enough experiments, not novel. There are too many writing errors&quot; (points out easily solvable thing like a broken cross reference or an incorrect issue like saying &#x27;these data&#x27;)). You can see part of this in HN comments too btw. Where people look at benchmarks and read them as answers instead of hints. Which there is an extra problem in that anything sufficiently novel will be unlikely to be state of the art on all things in the initial go. So it is easy to reject. Then the research is not pursued. But this is ludicrous when we&#x27;re talking about research, which is at a much lower level. The problem is people read research papers as if they are reviewing products. This can only stifle innovation. In machine learning there is the &quot;gpu rich&quot; and the &quot;gpu poor.&quot; I can with high confidence say that the &quot;gpu poor&quot; aren&#x27;t any worse at innovating, but rather that their works are just more likely to be rejected. How can you compete when others can spend 2-5x the money to tune parameters when what the paper is about is an architectural change or a change to optimization methods. We aren&#x27;t holding variables equal here and very few want to admit it.",

    "text": "Yes. And also because their rules are lax.<p>The state is what it is today because bussiness-friendly New Jersey raised their state taxes in 1911, so corporations fled to Delaware. Another important piece of background information is that there exists a council of the Delaware bar which is a group of 27 lawyers — who often have very close ties to industry — that craft proposals. The council then passes their proposals to the state legislature who rubber stamp them into law because these politicians can’t speak the necessary legalese to audit the bills, but more importantly, because these legislators don’t want to cross the power brokers sitting on the council. Effectively, the Delaware’s legislature is run by 27 unelected corporate lawyers who (over many decades) have turned the state into the Cayman Islands.<p>Moreover, I agree the laws are consistent in Delaware, but its not like New York doesn’t have just as strong, if not stronger, history of legal precedent. Favoring Delaware because its \n“large amount of precedence and case law” is a euphemism for “large amount of precedence and case law <i>in favor of corporate interests</i>”.<p>Source:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freakonomics.com&#x2F;podcast&#x2F;why-does-one-tiny-state-set-the-rules-for-everyone&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freakonomics.com&#x2F;podcast&#x2F;why-does-one-tiny-state-set...</a><p>Edit: the podcast I mention also discusses a lot about the looseness of Delaware’s laws. One example they bring up is how little effort it takes to incorporate in the state, leading to criminals choosing to incorporate in Delaware to legitimize their illicit operations. This is just one example.",

He used it to refer to an intersection of nerd culture with Silicon Valley-influenced ideology descended from the online rationalist movement.<p>Ok, checking the Slate Star Codex:<p>&gt; [Grey Tribe is defined by] libertarian political beliefs, Dawkins-style atheism, vague annoyance that the question of gay rights even comes up, eating paleo, drinking Soylent, calling in rides on Uber, reading lots of blogs, calling American football “sportsball”, getting conspicuously upset about the War on Drugs and the NSA, and listening to filk<p>So... to wrap it up, the reason for calling Mangione a rationalist is that he is &quot;associated with&quot; &quot;libertarianism, Dawkins-style atheism, etc.&quot;, which have &quot;descended from the rationalist movement&quot;.<p>Somehow I am not convinced.

So if you expose the public to many different biased opinions and let them learn to recognize the biases and see past them, the &quot;cumulative mindset&quot; will be more objective and less prone to manipulation.<p>But if you let one biased group decide what the majority is allowed to see, the public opinion will inevitably align with the interests of that group, and won&#x27;t be necessary beneficial to the public.<p>Have you noticed how in the past decade or two we have totally abandoned the pursuit of happiness through self-reliance and independence? How being depressed and outraged is normal, and is all but encouraged. This is all coming from the media actively shaping what gets into one&#x27;s attention span and it will only be causing more and more misery with no end in sight.<p>And this comes down to a very simple formula. Media likes people who will create content for free. People who are willing to do are often unhappy and have a mindset that causes unhappiness. Media broadcasting their content (to their own profit, of course) is popularizing that mindset and making more people miserable. Bingo!",

Voters care about that shit too, so you can&#x27;t claim &quot;overthrowing democracy&quot; is the exclusive of the GOP. In both cases, the election was theirs to lose, and they lost it quite actively.<p>When the new crowd (AOC etc.) get introduced to Congress and are immediately told &quot;these are the corporations whose interests you are supposed to stand for&quot;? Voters remember that, so you can&#x27;t just claim Trump is more corrupt than anyone else.<p>Or to take a step back: In 2008, Obama got elected on a promise of change, but by-and-large just did more of the same. Trump withdrew us from Afghanistan disastrously, but he only had to because the actually-competent people had <i>refused</i> to for over a decade, even though America was already sick of Vietnam 2.0.<p>Now, I <i>do</i> think Trump is a very bad thing for the US. But he&#x27;s only a symptom of a problem that has gone unaddressed for a long time.",

The library is almost entirely written from scratch, with just a single dependency (49KB gzip).<p>Since rendering and encoding happen mostly on the GPU, client-side, it’s blazingly fast. And with no need for backend rendering infrastructure, integration into any website is simple and lightweight.<p>One ed-tech startup used it to turn study materials into engaging videos and scaled to $200K MRR in just 9 months using the engine.<p>Some of its key features are:<p><pre><code>  - Video&#x2F;Audio Clipping\n  - Engaging Captions\n  - Waveform Visualization\n  - Shapes &amp; Overlays\n  - Keyframe Animations\n</code></pre>\nWould love for you to check it out and hack away with it!<p>Try it for free  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;diffusionstudio&#x2F;core\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;diffusionstudio&#x2F;core</a><p>A star would mean the world!",

Also, they were leaving Dwight D. Eisenhower airport in Kansas. Eisenhower, the supreme commander of allied forces in WW2 who warned against the &quot;military industrial complex&quot;. Wichita has so many air-related industries there that it was once known as the &quot;Air capital of the world&quot; and it&#x27;s still its primary industry.<p>There&#x27;s probably also something there about the fact that the plane was a Canadian one (Bombardier) whose name means &quot;the guy releasing the bombs in a bomber&quot;. And also, the Bombardier company was started by a guy just trying to get people around (mass transit) in the winter time (via the first good snowmobiles B7, B12 - powered by american-made engines from Ford&#x2F;Chrysler). And the helicopter was from a US company started by a Russian immigrant (Sikorsky) who immigrated to the US to escape the Russian Revolution after making bombers (that hold bombardiers) in WW1. And the helicopter crashed into a river, Potomac, named after the Algonquian word for a native american city and was itself named after a native american war chief (Black Hawk) that fought alongside the Canadians&#x2F;British in the war of 1812 (where the white house and capitol were set on fire) to &quot;push away white settlers&quot;. The helicopter left a fort (Fort Belvoir) named after a former slave plantation. The airfield it departed was named after a WW2 aviation engineer (Davison) and where Army One, the helicopter that carried Eisenhower, used to be based. In addition to the Black Hawks, the  airfield is also home to 4 cessnas used in civilian air patrol - made in Wichita.",

The checkout in this case will change the commit of the submodule just like it changes the blob of a file (using --recurse-submodules you also update the submodule directory).<p>But, yeah, it still depends on the existence of the commits on the submodule repo, which may not exist after performing a git push -f or a squash merge (that last case I discussed here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lucasoshiro.github.io&#x2F;posts-en&#x2F;2024-06-27-squash-submodule&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lucasoshiro.github.io&#x2F;posts-en&#x2F;2024-06-27-squash-sub...</a>)<p>&gt;  but I feel this could be solved better<p>Of course!

The status quo after given another 4 years of chance was flatly rejected in favor of a return to change.<p>&gt;I question each day whether that needs to be respected or we should resist.<p>Well, considering you guys villified Republicans and Trump voters post-2020 (and justifiably so to some degree), I would assume the answer was always the former. Indeed, certain Democrats crying that 2024 was stolen or the like are hypocritical echoes of the same from Republicans and Trump voters in 2020. The pendulum swung back, as it always does.<p>&gt;I also wonder if his supporters have any idea of what is going on.<p>I do, at least.<p>With regards specifically to Phyllis Fong, I have no confidence that an Inspector-General that occupied the office for <i>twenty two years straight</i>[1] can ethically perform their prescribed role.

The job wasn&#x27;t so much to tell them what to work on so much as make sure there aren&#x27;t things blocking them and to make sure they don&#x27;t get stuck in the rabbit holes. Of course it was never all sunshine and roses, but it did seem that the environments were a lot more flexible. Even several recent Veritasium videos have talked about people who just essentially didn&#x27;t do their actual job for like a year, &quot;slacking off&quot;, and how this gave them the opportunities to explore certain ideas.<p>I really think we have to admit how many dark horses there are when it comes to innovation. If we don&#x27;t provide space for them, then we slow progress down. If we don&#x27;t create an environment, then it slows. Do we really want to go back to the time where most science was performed by the wealthy? Because only they were the ones who had the luxury of being able to explore?<p>I often think back to Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Profession&quot;[0]. I can&#x27;t help but think this in part was a critique on academia and the relationship to this issue.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Profession_(novella)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Profession_(novella)</a>",

    "text": "Perhaps I overemphasized it, but a personal experience on that front was key to realizing that the lesswrong community was in aggregate a bunch of bullshit sophistic larpers.<p>In short, some real world system had me asking a simply poised probabilities question.  I eventually solved it.  I learned two things as a result, one (which I kinda knew, but didn&#x27;t &#x27;know&#x27; before) is that the formal answer to even very simple question can be extremely complicated (e.g. asking for the inverse of a one line formal turning into a half page of extremely dense math), and two that many prominent members of the lesswrong community were completely clueless about the practice of the tools they advocate, not even knowing the most basic search keywords or realizing that there was little hope of most of their fans ever applying these tools to all but the absolute simplest questions.<p>&gt; You can absolutely make meaningful predictions about the world despite uncertainties. A good model can tell you that a hurricane might<p>Thanks for the example though--  reasoning about hurricanes is the result of decades of research by thousands of people, the inputs involve data from thousands of weather stations including floating buoys, multiple satellites, and aircraft that fly through the storms to get data.  The calculations include numerous empirically derived constants that provide averages for unmeasureable quantities for inputs that the models need plus adhoc corrections to fit model outputs to previously observed behavior.<p>And the results, while extremely useful, are vague and not particularly precise-- there are many questions they can&#x27;t answer.<p>While it is a calculation, it is very much an example of empiracy being primary over reason.<p>And if someone is thinking that our success with hurricane modeling tells them anything about their ability to &#x27;reason things out&#x27; from their own life, without decades of experience, data collection, satellite monitoring, teams of PHD,  then they&#x27;re just mistaken.  It&#x27;s just not comparable.<p>Reasoning things out, with or without the aid of data, can absolutely be of use.  But that utility is bounded by the quality of our data, our understanding of the world, errors in our reasoning process, etc.  And people <i>do</i> engage in that level of reasoning all the time.  But it&#x27;s not more primary than it is because of the significant and serious limitations.<p>I suspect that the effort require to calculate things out also comes with a big risk of overconfidence.  Like, stick your thumb in the air, make some rough cash flow calculations, etc.  That&#x27;s a good call and probably captures the vast majority of predictive power for some new business.  But if instead you make some complicated multi-agent computational model of the business it might only have a little be more predictive power but a lot more risk of following it off a cliff when experience is suggesting the predictions were wrong.<p>&gt; people do things in dumb inefficient ways all the time<p>Or, even more often, they&#x27;re optimizing for a goal different than yours, one that might not even be legible to you!<p>&gt; just as that model predicted it would be, because I did the math and my competitors in a crowded space did not.<p>or so you think!  Often organizations fail to do &quot;obvious&quot; things because there are considerations that just aren&#x27;t visible or relevant to outsiders, rather than any failure of reasoning.<p>For example, I&#x27;ve been part of an org that could have pivoted to a different product and made more money... but doing so would have meant laying off a bunch of people that everyone really liked working with.  The extra money wasn&#x27;t worth it.  Whomever eventually scooped up that business might have thought they were smart for seeing it where we didn&#x27;t, but if so they&#x27;d be wrong about why we didn&#x27;t do it.  We saw the opportunity and just had different objectives.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t for a moment argue that collections of people don&#x27;t do stupid things, they do-- but there is a lot less stupid than you might assume on first analysis.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s just that that usually happens in areas where you have singularly deep expertise, not where you were just a Really Smart Dude and thought super hard about philosophy<p>We agree completely there-- but it&#x27;s really about the data and expertise.  Sure, you have to do the thinking to connect the dots, and then have the courage and conviction (or hunger) to execute on it.  You may need all three of data, expertise, and fancy calculations.  But the third is sometimes optional and the former two are almost never optional and usually can only be replaced by luck, not &#x27;reasoning&#x27;.",

    "text": "I don&#x27;t, that one&#x27;s me speaking from my own speculation. It&#x27;s a working model I&#x27;ve had for a while about the nature of a lot of kinds of mental illness (particularly my own tendencies towards depression), which I guess I should explain more thoroughly! This gets a bit abstract, so stick with me: it&#x27;s a toy model, and I don&#x27;t mean it to be definitive truth, but it seems to do well at explaining my own tendencies.<p>-------<p>So, toy model: imagine the brain has a single 1-dimensional happiness value that changes over time. You can be +3 happy or -2 unhappy, that kind of thing. Everyone knows when you&#x27;re very happy you tend to come down, and when you&#x27;re very sad you tend to eventually shake it off, meaning that there is something of a tendency towards a moderate value or a set-point of sorts. For the sake of simplicity, let&#x27;s say a normal person has a set point of 0, then maybe a depressive person has a set point of -1, a manic person has a set point of +1, that sort of thing.<p>Mathematically, this is similar to the equations that describe a spring. If left to its own devices, a spring will tend to its equilibrium value, either exponentially (if overdamped) or with some oscillation around it (if underdamped). But if you&#x27;re a person living your life, there are things constantly jostling the spring up and down, which is why manic people aren&#x27;t crazy all the time and depressed people have some good days where they feel good and can smile. Mathematically, this is a spring with a forcing function - as though it&#x27;s sitting on a rough train ride that is constantly applying &quot;random&quot; forces to it. Rather than x&#x27;&#x27; + kx = 0, you&#x27;ve got x&#x27;&#x27; + kx = f(t) for some external forcing function f(t), where f(t) critically does not depend on x or on the individual internal dynamics involved.<p>These external forcing functions tend to be pretty similar among people of a comparable environment. But the internal equilibria seem to be quite different. So when the external forcing is strong, it tends to pull people in similar directions, and people whose innate tendencies are extreme tend to get pulled along with the majority anyway. But when external forcing is weak (or when people are decoupled from its effects on them), internal equilibria tend to take over, and extreme people can get caught in feedback loops.<p>If you&#x27;re a little more ML-inclined, you can think about external influences like a temperature term in an ML model. If your personal &quot;model&quot; of the world tends to settle into a minimum labeled &quot;completely crazy&quot; or &quot;severely depressed&quot; or the like, a high &quot;temperature&quot; can help jostle you out of that minimum even if your tendencies always move in that direction.<p>Basically, I think weird nerds tend to have low &quot;temperature&quot; values, and tend to settle into their own internal equilibria, whether those are good, bad, or good in some cases and bad in others (consider all the genius mathematicians who were also nuts). &quot;Normies&quot;, for lack of a better way of putting it, tend to have high temperature values and live their lives across a wider region of state space, which reduces their ability to wield precision and competitive advantage but protects them from the most extreme failure-modes as well.",

    "text": "Pardon the cult-like musings ahead of time, but it’s par for the course.<p>My initial thought was rationalism is obviously egoic and selfobsessed, loving and trusting ones own thoughts. Set theory should tell you that you cant make a mental image of yourself to act by that will be more encompassing than the totality of what you are. You can’t build a mental model inside of your ego that will work better than your natural instinct for all interaction with reality. Trust sheer emotion to say that rationalising any loss of life means an upside down philosophy, a castle in the sky. This cult with its ”functional decision theory” […that the normative principle for action is to treat one’s decision as the output of a ﬁxed mathematical function”]\nmakes actions a sort of cold choice without emotion. Like people using religion in war to remain cool when killing, a misuse of a neutral idea such as a mathematical function.<p>But it can’t be that easy to handwave it away. When Aum Shinrikyo was mentioned down below, I changed my mind, there’s no easy answers. A sick leader can justify anything and you can judge any tree from its fruits. From doctrine section on that wikipedia: ”Their teachings claimed a nuclear apocalypse was predicted to occur soon” (Parallell to AI now in rationalism), ”Furthermore, Lifton believes, Asahara &quot;interpreted the Tibetan Buddhist concept of phowa in order to claim that by killing someone contrary to the group&#x27;s aims, they were preventing them from accumulating bad karma and thus saving them&quot; ” (Parallell to rational behavior guidance gone wrong, these datascientists just lost touch, Norm Macdonald would say theyre real jerks pardon the humor).<p>I just the other day listened to Eckhart Tolles podcast where he talked about doomsday fear, on the bottom of the transcript it says: [“There&#x27;s also an unconscious desire in many human beings for what we could call the collapse of the human made world.<p>Because most humans experience the world as a burden. They have to live in this world, but the world is problematic. The world has a heaviness to it.<p>You have your job, you have the taxes, you have money, and the world is complex and heavy. And there&#x27;s an unconscious longing for people in what we might bluntly call the end of the world. But ultimately, what they are longing for is, yes, it is a kind of liberation, but the ultimate liberation that they are really longing for is the liberation from themselves, the liberation from what they experience as their problematic, heavy sense of self that&#x27;s inseparable from the so-called outer world.<p>And so there&#x27;s a longing in every human for that. But that&#x27;s not going to happen yet.”]\n Eckhart Tolle: Essential Teachings: Essential Teachings Special: Challenging Times Can Awaken Us 30 jan. 2025<p>Obvious parallell to AI doomsaying can be drawn.<p>When we were children we experienced unfiltered reality without formulas to replace our decisions. But we could even then be wrong, stupid, or convinced to do stupid shit by a charismatic playground bully. But when we were wrong it resulted in falling and scraping our knee or whatever. Theres no reality checks in internet culture bubbles.<p>This is sick people huddling together under a sick charismatic warlord-ish leader whose castle in the sky is so selfcoherent that it makes others want to systemize it aided by the brainwashing methods.[”Zizians believe normal ideas about morality are mostly obfuscated nonsense. They think real morality is simple and has already been put to paper by Jeremy Bentham with his utilitarian ideas. Bentham famously predicted an expanding scope of moral concern. He says if humanity is honest with itself it will eventually adopt uncompromising veganism. Zizians think arguments which don&#x27;t acknowledge this are not about morality at all, they&#x27;re about local struggles for power delaying the removal of an unjust status quo.”] <i>Insert Watchmen pic of grandiose narc Adrian Veidt asking Dr Manhattan if utilitarian masskilling was the right choice</i><p>And then the sleep deprivation indoctrination method dulls even their rationality even further. So they can all become ego clones of the cultleader.<p>And that other link in this thread mentioned other groups of rationalists debugging from demons sent by adversary groups and other psychotic stuff, yeah is it the chicken or the egg where those people gather in a place where people loop with their mind or is it the mindlooping that sends them in a downwards spiral. Maybe we should calculate the bayesian.",

But, in my deep learning code and works, when I need to design an operation that involves a mix as little as 3 tensors with 4+ dimensions, I always struggle. I need to draft some slices to understand which slice should be contracted etc.. Many times the shape of the output is not even clear in my mind. Plus, add some padding mask<i>S</i> on the tensors and it confuses me quite a lot. \nI really like this notation, the last example of 1.1 is readable in its sum formulation, but the diagram formulation is much more &quot;alive&quot; in my mind.<p>I am really lost here if I have missed something about indices notations with tensors or some visualization techniques. Or maybe the confusion of a tensor operation depends of the field? Or maybe I just miss practices and experiences with indices notations...",

Nicholas Denyer observes that the Sophists &quot;did ... have one important thing in common: whatever else they did or did not claim to know, they characteristically had a great understanding of what words would entertain or impress or persuade an audience.&quot;<p>The problem then, as of now, is sorting the wheat from the chaff. Rationalist spaces like &#x2F;r&#x2F;SSC, The Motte, et. al are just modern sophistry labs that like to think they&#x27;re filled with the next Socrates when they&#x27;re actually filled with endless Thrasymachi.

So...about $4 billion&#x2F;year for 10 years.<p>Various studies put the economic damage in the US due to lead pipes in water systems at about $50 billion per year so this regulation looks like a net win.<p>Around $1.1 trillion of their claimed $1.8 trillion is from increased fuel efficiency and decreased emissions requirements for cars and trucks.<p>US economic loses due to air pollution range from around $500 billion to $1 trillion per year. Even a modest reduction in air pollution will save a lot (and increase fuel efficiency can save consumers quit a bit of money), so it seems likely that over 10-20 years these regulations would be a net win.

    "text": "I think you can reasonably think about the flight path by modeling the movement on the hyperbolic upper half plane (x would be the position along the linear path between endpoints, y the side length of the viewport).<p>I considered two metrics that ended up being equivalent. First, minimizing loaded tiles assuming a hierarchical tiled map. The cost of moving x horizontally is just x&#x2F;y tiles, using y as the side length of the viewport. Zooming from y_0 to y_1 loads abs(log_2(y_1&#x2F;y_0)) tiles, which is consistent with ds = dy&#x2F;y. Together this is just ds^2 = (dx^2 + dy^2)&#x2F;y^2, exactly the upper-half-plane metric.<p>Alternatively, you could think of minimizing the &quot;optical flow&quot; of the viewport in some sense. This actually works out to the same metric up to scaling - panning by x without zooming, everything is just displaced by x&#x2F;y (i.e. the shift as a fraction of the viewport). Zooming by a factor k moves a pixel at (u,v) to (k*u,k*v), a displacement of (u,v)*(k-1). If we go from a side length of y to y+dy, this is (u,v)*dy&#x2F;y, so depending how exactly we average the displacements this is some constant times dy&#x2F;y.<p>Then the geodesics you want are just the horocycles, circles with centers at y=0, although you need to do a little work to compute the motion along the curve. Once you have the arc, from θ_0 to θ_1, the total time should come from integrating dtheta&#x2F;y = dθ&#x2F;sin(θ), so to be exact you&#x27;d have to invert t = ln(csc(θ)-cot(θ)), so it&#x27;s probably better to approximate. edit: mathematica is telling me this works out to θ = atan2(1-2*e^(2t), 2*e^t) which is not so bad at all.<p>Comparing with the &quot;blub space&quot; logic, I think the effective metric there is ds^2 = dz^2 + (z+1)^2 dx^2, polar coordinates where z=1&#x2F;y is the zoom level, which (using dz=dy&#x2F;y^2) works out to ds^2 = dy^2&#x2F;y^4 + dx^2*(1&#x2F;y^2 + ...). I guess this means the existing implementation spends much more time panning at high zoom levels compared to the hyperbolic model, since zooming from 4x to 2x costs twice as much as 2x to 1x despite being visually the same.",

Fact is still, this is not only a &quot;currently supported&quot; system by some technicality like the final months of a 5 year lts release or something, this is the up to this very minute version of a massive install base, with a 20 year old version of something as basic and all-touching as the very shell itself.<p>I know about this so intimately because I actually have scripts that don&#x27;t work because they were intentional stunts to see just what could be done without forking any external exes or even child shells, but allow using every possible feature and trick in bash itself.)",

Well after signing up and starting the instance and doing some quick tests. I ended up coming back to it a bit later and found out the account was just out right terminated. After a while of going through support and looking around at what logs I could get, turns out they tried to do a $0.01 charge on the card and since it failed marked the card as stolen (or something similar.) And even with a long conversation with support they told me there was literally nothing that could be done, not even with proof of identification or anything. Even making a new account didn&#x27;t work since something was matching and they were rejecting me making a new account (don&#x27;t know if it was address, ip or my name.)<p>At this point I share the opinion that others here are sharing, no matter the reason never work with oracle. I&#x27;m just lucky they made the decision for me and I never even have to consider the choice again.",

The notification requirement is in addition to this but there&#x27;s no language which says that the removal power is conditioned on obeying the notification requirement. So Trump <i>legally</i> removed the IGs, and then as a side-effect broke the law by failing to notify Congress.<p>There&#x27;s a problem with how the law is written though... It supposedly required Trump to notify Congress before he was even President, but its requirements also only apply to the President. Arguably the law was impossible to follow as written, and I gather that&#x27;s not even the strongest constitutional problem with the law as written. What we have here is a failure of Congress, and Trump exploiting it.",

Why would I let anyone upstream dictate how those rules should apply, on <i>my</i> computer, in <i>my</i> editor? For example, when working in a Clojure codebase, I don&#x27;t want to blindly rely on CIDER completions because they work only when you have a connected REPL. I want to leverage LSP completions (if it&#x27;s connected), and I also want completions for my code snippets, filenames, keywords specific to the language, words in comments, etc.<p>If tomorrow I wanted to use different rules, applying them dynamically based on some conditions - Emacs provides ways to achieve that.<p>So yes, for completions specifically, I don&#x27;t want them to be rigidly embedded in the core of Emacs. I prefer this feature to be an extension. Interestingly, Emacs is so versatile that some extensions are built so well that sometimes you completely forget they are not built-in features or an afterthought; they feel as if the editor was specifically designed to have them.",

He instead did a Jeb Bush presidency, complete with Wall Street (Mnuchin) and the CIA (Pompeo) running the country exactly as would have occurred had Bush won. So Americans tried Biden, in the hopes of a return to Obama era America. This obviously didn&#x27;t happen, as standard of living continued to decline.

At least speaking for myself (a former member of those circles), I do indeed sit down and write quantitative models when I want to estimate things rigorously, and I can&#x27;t be the only one who does.<p>&gt; Indeed, as well as just ignoring that uncertainties about the state of the world or the model of interaction utterly dominate any &quot;calculation&quot; that you could hope to do.<p>This, on the other hand, I don&#x27;t think is a valid criticism nor correct taken in isolation.<p>You can absolutely make meaningful predictions about the world despite uncertainties. A good model can tell you that a hurricane might hit Tampa but won&#x27;t hit New Orleans, even though weather is the textbook example of a medium-term chaotic system. A good model can tell you when a bridge needs to be inspected, even though there are numerous reasons for failure that you cannot account for. A good model can tell you whether a growth is likely to become cancerous, even though oncogenesis is stochastic.<p>Maybe a bit more precisely, even if logic cannot tell you what sets of beliefs are correct, it <i>can</i> tell you what sets of beliefs are <i>inconsistent with one another</i>. For example, if you think event X has probability 50%, and you think event Y has probability 20% conditional on X, it would be inconsistent for you to believe event Y has a probability of less than 10%.<p>&gt; The world at large is does not spend all its time in lesswrongian ritual multiplication or whatever... but this is not because they&#x27;re educated stupid<p>When I thought about founding my company last January, one of the first things I did was sit down and make a toy model to estimate whether the unit economics would be viable. It said they would be, so I started the company. It is now profitable with wide operating margins, just as that model predicted it would be, because I did the math and my competitors in a crowded space did not.<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s possible to be overconfident, but let&#x27;s not forget where we are: startups win because people do things in dumb inefficient ways <i>all the time</i>. Sometimes everyone <i>is</i> wrong and you <i>are</i> right, it&#x27;s just that that usually happens in areas where you have singularly deep expertise, not where you were just a Really Smart Dude and thought super hard about philosophy.",

Most of the insurrectionists (the people who invaded Congress, not the people who went home after attending the rally) in Jan 6th can be described as such. That network of &#x27;friends&#x27; is critical for actually motivating them to get off their ass and act on their beliefs.<p>&gt; More compassion for self and others would be my preference.<p>The problem is that it&#x27;s much easier to violently destroy, than it is to create, and the damage that a group of angry people who believe an utterly insane thing is disproportionate.",
